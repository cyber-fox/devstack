# devstack

Web development boilerplate.

----

## Prerequisites

1. Windows/macOS/Linux
2. **Git** https://git-scm.com/downloads (default Win install settings are fine)
3. **Node.js** + NPM https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (default Win install settings are OK)

Run `npm install npm -g` after Node.js installation.  
TortoiseGit https://tortoisegit.org/ is recommended for Windows users.

## Installation

1. Open command line (e.g. Git Bash) in project (package root) folder
2. Run `npm install` and follow instructions

For review purposes run just `npm install --production`. It won't install [devDepenencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#devdependencies).
